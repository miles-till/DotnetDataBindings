# DotnetDataBinding Samples

Super simple sample projects demonstrating the use of CommunityToolkit.Mvvm with common dotnet UI frameworks.

## IDE Extensions

For consistency the following extensions are used for auto-formatting code:

- [CSharpier](https://github.com/belav/csharpier)
- [XamlStyler](https://github.com/Xavalon/XamlStyler)

## Projects

### DotnetDataBindings.WinForms

WinForms data binding is written in code-behind rather than using the visual designer, so that it isn't hidden amongst the
rest of the generated UI designer code.

### DotnetDataBindings.DXWinForms (DevExpress WinForms)

> [!NOTE]
> Requires a DevExpress subscription with access to the DevExpress Nuget feed.

### DotnetDataBindings.WPF

### Avalonia UI
